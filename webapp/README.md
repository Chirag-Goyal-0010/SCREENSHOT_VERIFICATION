Got it âœ… You want a **Scrum breakdown** for your **Screenshot Verification Project**, so you can manage it in an Agile way and build it step by step from scratch.

Hereâ€™s a **Scrum framework** tailored to your project:

---

# ðŸ“Œ Screenshot Verification Project â€” Scrum Framework

## **Product Vision**

Build a scalable system that verifies whether a screenshot of a social media post is authentic or tampered with, using a multi-stage AI pipeline (pHash â†’ VGG16 â†’ Cloud Vision/AWS) with cost optimization.

---

## **High-Level Product Backlog (Epics â†’ User Stories)**

### **Epic 1: Project Setup**

* As a developer, I want a **Rails backend** so that I can handle uploads and APIs.
* As a developer, I want a **PostgreSQL database** so that I can store images, results, and logs.
* As a developer, I want **Sidekiq (background jobs)** so that processing can be async and scalable.

---

### **Epic 2: Image Upload & Storage**

* As a user, I want to **upload screenshots** via web/mobile so that they can be verified.
* As the system, I want to **store images in database/cloud storage** so that they can be analyzed later.
* As a developer, I want to **validate file formats (JPEG, PNG)** so invalid inputs are rejected early.

---

### **Epic 3: pHash Preprocessing**

* As the system, I want to **compute perceptual hash (pHash)** so that I can quickly detect near-duplicates.
* As the system, I want to **decide (Accept/Reject/Borderline) based on pHash thresholds**.
* As a developer, I want to **log pHash similarity scores** for later debugging.

---

### **Epic 4: VGG16 Feature Extraction**

* As the system, I want to **extract feature vectors with VGG16** so that I can measure deeper similarity.
* As the system, I want to **apply cosine similarity rules** so that I can decide borderline cases.
* As a developer, I want to **use GPU acceleration (local/EC2/Colab)** so analysis runs fast.

---

### **Epic 5: Borderline Case Handling (Cloud Vision / AWS Rekognition)**

* As the system, I want to **call Cloud Vision/AWS Rekognition only for borderline images** so that costs remain low.
* As the system, I want to **perform OCR and object detection** so that I can confirm suspicious screenshots.
* As a developer, I want to **store API responses** for audits and debugging.

---

### **Epic 6: Decision & Reporting**

* As a user, I want to **see the final decision (Valid / Invalid / Borderline)** with a **confidence score**.
* As the system, I want to **show which stage made the decision** so results are transparent.
* As a developer, I want **detailed logs** for performance and error tracking.

---

### **Epic 7: Cost & Performance Optimization**

* As a developer, I want to **minimize cloud API calls** so costs stay predictable.
* As the system, I want to **cache results of duplicate images** so I donâ€™t re-analyze the same screenshot.
* As the team, we want **performance monitoring (time per stage, cost per 1M images)** so the system scales.

---

## **Sprint Plan (Example for 4 Sprints)**

### **Sprint 1 (Setup & Upload Flow)**

* Rails 8 project setup
* PostgreSQL integration
* Image upload & storage
* Background job setup (Sidekiq)

**Deliverable**: Users can upload and store screenshots.

---

### **Sprint 2 (pHash Analysis)**

* Implement pHash calculation in Python
* Integrate with Rails backend via API/job
* Apply decision thresholds (Accept/Reject/Borderline)
* Save results in DB

**Deliverable**: Basic local verification with pHash.

---

### **Sprint 3 (VGG16 Analysis)**

* Implement VGG16 feature extraction (Keras/PyTorch)
* Cosine similarity check
* Pipeline integration after pHash
* GPU setup (local or cloud)

**Deliverable**: Robust verification with pHash + VGG16.

---

### **Sprint 4 (Borderline Handling & Reporting)**

* Integrate Cloud Vision / AWS Rekognition for borderline cases
* Build decision + confidence reporting
* Implement result dashboard (admin view)
* Add logs, monitoring, cost estimation

**Deliverable**: Full end-to-end pipeline with reporting.

---

## **Definition of Done (DoD)**

âœ… Code reviewed and merged
âœ… Automated tests passed
âœ… Documentation updated
âœ… Deployed in staging environment
âœ… Performance tested with sample screenshots

ðŸ‘‰ Now, do you want me to create the **initial folder/file structure + task breakdown for Sprint 1** so you can start coding right away?
